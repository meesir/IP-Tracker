This script was created for Ubuntu 16.4


To use this you must have sendemail installed [sudo apt-get install sendemail]

IP is checked via web API - https://www.ipify.org/

I set a cron job to run the script, if there's no change in IP nothing happens,
if there is a change of IP an email is sent via gmail to me letting me know the new IP.  The file .myIp is also updated with the new IP address.
